##### Goals:

To understand peopleâ€™s opinions on different visualizations: Different views on graphs and visualizations help us to understand their importance and the structural necessity of existing and most-used graphs.

Validate if factors like age, work experience, and gender impact their opinion:  Usually applying the learned classroom concepts to real-life work-related problems gives us a better understanding of what is more meaningful for business insights. Thus, we checked if factors like experience, age, and gender showed a huge impact on choices.
